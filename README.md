# Project: where to point our gaming company

  This project has been developed with the intention to accomodate as many as possible requirements as possible according with the professionals there are in the company. For this reason, and trying to give a priority to these requirements, the first thing done was to check which "weight" has every kind of professional; according to this our main priorities were retrieved from the designers and the account managers as seen below

## Filtering companies

  Following this, we create our queries throughout MongoDB about companies which could be an example in terms of ubication and conditions, filtering, first of all, via using Regex to get the companies with terms like "tech", "gaming", "software"... adn grouping them by cities, giving the result of the top ten cities world-wide,as below:
![top_ten_co](/pics/city_comp.png)

  On the other hand, also was filtered those companies which they produced more than US$1M; for that, we also checked the currency how the companies declared their income and applied the exchange rate getting, on one side the amount of companies which they declare their incomes, which is the 95% in US$,followed by a 3% in â‚¬.
- Income of companies by rates
![currency](/pics/co_income.png)
- Table with the list of companies by currency

Finally, we got the top ten companies via income:

and their ubication

  Matching both results we can find that the best opportunity should be around San Francisco or Palo Alto, even getting into consideration the distance to Silicon Valley.
  
## Checking the companies obtained around S.F.O. and our criteria

  Our criteria followed was the next one:
 - Starbucks in range of 500m
 - Bus-stop in range of 1000m
 - Parking in range of 500m
 - Airport in range of 50km
 - Schools in range of 5km
 - Vegetarian/Vegan Restaurantes in range of 500m
 - Basketball court in range of 10km
 
  Within the 4 companies which are allocated in S.F.O. area the only one have met all was Zynga, a video game company which was allocated in San Francisco, 365 Vermont St.
  
  The good point of choosing their offices is the fact they have moved in 2022 [(real state)]("https://myelisting.com/listing/258300/365-vermont-street-san-francisco-ca-94103/") after being bought by Take-Tow Interactive.
  [Zynga ref]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga#:~:text=Zynga%20began%20trading%20on%20NASDAQ,plays%20Zynga%27s%20games%20every%20month.")
  
  As we can see below, the position has the facilities required by staff; the only two requirements were mentioned during the plan but have been not considered are the party placements and dog hairdressers; the first one was discarded as being in the city center, will not be really difficult to find places to go party and, also, there might be different preferences of kind of leisure activities which could not fit with just partying; on the other side, the dog's requirements were also not considered as, if there's nothing found around, as part of the company, everyone of the staff should care about him, so, we could take turns for washing it.
